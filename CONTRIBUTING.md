# Contributing to 🌿 Fluoly
- I love your input! I want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

> - Reporting a bug
> - Discussing the current state of the code
> - Submitting a fix
> - Proposing new features
> - Becoming a maintainer

## 🪒 I Develop with Github
- I use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## 💾 All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests
- Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. I actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

## 🖥 Any contributions you make will be under the MPL-2.0 Software License
- In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [license ⇗](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mpl-2.0/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## 📢 Report bugs using Github's [issues ⇗](https://github.com/retr0cube/fluoly/issues)
- I use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by opening a new issue; it's that easy!

## 🐜 Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code
- **Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

> - A quick summary and/or background
> - Steps to reproduce
> - Be specific!
> - Give sample code if you can. [Example stackoverflow question ⇗](https://stackoverflow.com/>questions/419163/what-does-if-name-main-do) includes sample code that *anyone* with a base
>Python setup can run to reproduce what I was seeing.
> - What you expected would happen ?
> - What actually happens ?
> - Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that > didn't work)

* People *😍 love* thorough bug reports. I'm not even kidding.

## 🥻 Use a Consistent Coding Style

* **4 spaces** for indentation rather than tabs, **2 spaces** for `.yaml` package files.
* You can try running `pylint` or an online website for style unification.
