Blender 2.93 addon for working with Minecraft models.

### Discord
You can contact me about the project on the [Bedrock OSS](https://discord.gg/XjV87YN) discord.

## Features
- Exporting models for Minecraft bedrock edition. Custom Minecraft model
  properties like `mirror`, `inflate` or `locator` are supported.
- Exporting animations for Minecraft bedrock edition. Support for Minecraft
  property `anim_time_update`.
- Importing models from Minecraft bedrock edition.
- Generating the UV maps and the template textures.
- Easy way to create animations that would be really tedious to do thanks to
  physics simulation and rigging.
